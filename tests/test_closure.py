"""Decomposition / budget closure tests (amocvocab spec section 6.4 + Appendix A).

A registered ``exact`` decomposition makes a checkable promise: its component variables
sum to the total, per element, to within a tolerance. This is the one conformance test
no CF/attribute checker can do — it catches unit errors, sign errors, a missing term, and
a mislabelled component. Appendix A fixed the tolerance at 1e-9 relative (seven decades
below the mildest real error, safely above float32 storage noise).

Each relation is checked against the provider's SOURCE file using the provider's own
variable names (compare in source units; do not convert — Appendix A.1). The files are not
committed (they are large / zipped downloads), so every dataset is ``slow`` and skips
unless available locally via its env var or a cached copy under ``~/.amocatlas_data``.

Relations marked ``must_close=True`` are asserted to close; the MOCHA negatives assert the
check discriminates (Appendix A.3). Relations flagged "hypothesis" below are ones we expect
but have not yet verified against data — when the file is present they will confirm or refute.
