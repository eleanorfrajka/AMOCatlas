"""SAMBA (34.5S) decomposition closure tests — amocvocab spec section 6.4 + Appendix A.

Split into its own file (one ``test_closure_<array>.py`` per array) so that matching an
array to its registered closures stays a one-file lookup as the vocabulary is populated.

SAMBA's MOC-anomaly constituents come from a whitespace ``.asc`` rounded to 0.01 Sv and
contain sparse single-day glitch rows (~7% of rows spike by several Sv). Closure is
therefore checked on the MEDIAN absolute residual (robust to those glitches), not the max
used for the exact float64 netCDF budgets in ``test_closure.py``.

Two tiers are asserted (both checked against the provider source file, in source units —
Appendix A.1):
  exact       — components sum to the total within the provider's rounding step;
  approximate — components reconstruct the total within a stated physical tolerance (a real
                few-percent residual, not rounding).
The approximate bound is two-sided: the median must be below APPROX_TOL (it does close
roughly) AND at or above EXACT_TOL (it is genuinely approximate, not exact), so the tier
label stays meaningful. The file is a large download, so every case is ``slow`` and skips
unless the source is available locally.

Observed tiers (v2020 source, 1957 daily records):
  relative  = W_density + E_density   -> exact       (median 0.01 Sv)
  reference = W_botpres + E_botpres    -> approximate (median 0.15 Sv)
  total     = relative + reference + ekman -> approximate (median 0.31 Sv / 0.15 robust)
