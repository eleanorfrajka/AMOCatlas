"""AMOCatlas data source readers.

This package contains individual reader modules for each AMOC data source,
including observing arrays, datasets, and overflow measurements.

Each module provides a read function for accessing its specific data source
with consistent interfaces and error handling.

Module naming convention:
- Arrays include latitude: rapid26n, move16n, osnap55n, samba34s
- Special locations: wh41n (Willis & Hobbs), noac47n (North Atlantic Ocean Current)
- Datasets by author/year: fw2015, calafat2025, zheng2024
- Overflow locations: dso (Denmark Strait), fbc (Faroe Bank Channel)
