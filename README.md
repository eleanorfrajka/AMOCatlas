**One Python API for loading and comparing AMOC transport datasets — from moored observing arrays to satellite/Argo-based estimates — with consistent variable names, units, and metadata.**

AMOCatlas provides unified access to data on the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), which transports heat northward in the Atlantic and is a key component of the climate system. It spans both in-situ observing arrays (RAPID, OSNAP, MOVE, SAMBA, …) and blended or estimation-based products (satellite altimetry, Argo, and reanalysis-derived estimates). Instead of hand-parsing a different file format for each source, you load any of 20 datasets through one interface and get back standardised, analysis-ready `xarray` datasets.

AMOCatlas does not alter the underlying data. It re-serves the same values as the source publications, adding standardised units, variable names, attribution, and provenance metadata — so the numbers you analyse are the numbers you would cite from the original dataset.

## Available Data Sources

AMOCatlas serves two kinds of source, distinguished below. **Observing arrays** are direct in-situ measurements from moored instruments; **blended/estimated products** derive transports from satellite altimetry, Argo, XBT, or statistical methods. Both are served through the same `read.<name>()` interface.

## Installation

### From PyPI (Recommended)
```bash
pip install AMOCatlas
```

**Requirements**: Python ≥3.10, with numpy, pandas, xarray, and matplotlib.

### For Development
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AMOCcommunity/amocatlas.git
cd amocatlas
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pip install -e .
```

This installs amocatlas locally. The `-e` ensures that any edits you make in the files will be picked up by scripts that import functions from amocatlas.

## Quick Start

The `read` namespace returns a single standardised `xarray` dataset per array, downloading and caching on the first call:

```python
from amocatlas import read

ds = read.rapid()              # RAPID transport at 26°N
print(ds)

osnap = read.osnap()           # OSNAP; uses the latest version by default
```

Common options:

```python
read.osnap(version="2025")     # select a version where multiple exist
read.rapid(all_files=True)     # list of all files for an array, not just the standard one
read.rapid(raw=True)           # original upstream format, without standardisation
```

The legacy string-based API and small bundled samples remain available:

```python
from amocatlas import readers

ds = readers.load_sample_dataset("rapid")   # small bundled sample, no download
datasets = readers.load_dataset("rapid")    # returns a list of datasets
```

**Data location and logs.** Downloads are cached in `~/.amocatlas_data/` and a per-run `*.log` is written to `logs/`. Override the cache per call with `data_dir="/path/to/data"`, or set a default:

```python
import amocatlas
amocatlas.set_data_dir("~/my_data")    # custom location
print(amocatlas.get_data_dir())
```

The `set_data_dir("project")` shortcut (use `project/data`) only works from a source checkout (`pip install -e .`); regular installs need an explicit path.

For the full API, see the [documentation](https://amoccommunity.github.io/AMOCatlas/).

## Development

### Running Tests
All new functions should include tests. You can run tests locally and generate a coverage report with:
```bash
pytest --cov=amocatlas --cov-report term-missing tests/
```

Try to ensure that all the lines of your contribution are covered in the tests.

### Generating Dataset Reports
AMOCatlas includes automated report generation for dataset documentation:

```bash
# Generate reports for all supported arrays
python generate_report

# Generate report for a specific dataset
python generate_report --data_source rapid

# Generate reports with custom output directory
python generate_report --output_dir custom_reports/
```

Reports are generated as structured RST files in `docs/source/reports/` with:
- Dataset visualization plots
- Variable mapping tables (original → standardized names)
- Metadata documentation
- Temporal coverage analysis
- Statistical summaries

### Code Quality
```bash
ruff format amocatlas/ tests/     # Format code
ruff check amocatlas/ tests/     # Lint code
```

### Working with Notebooks
You can run the example jupyter notebook by launching jupyterlab with `jupyter-lab` and navigating to the `notebooks` directory, or in VS Code or another python GUI.

### Documentation
To build the documentation locally you need to install a few extra requirements:

- Install `make` for your computer, e.g. on ubuntu with `sudo apt install make`
- Install the additional python requirements. Activate the environment you use for working with amocatlas, navigate to the top directory of this repo, then run `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`

Once you have the extras installed, you can build the docs locally by navigating to the `docs/` directory and running `make clean html`. This command will create a directory called `build/` which contains the html files of the documentation. Open the file `docs/build/html/index.html` in your browser, and you will see the docs with your changes applied.

All contributions are welcome! See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.

## PyGMT add-on

AMOCatlas includes support for creating publication-quality figures using PyGMT. The demo notebook `notebooks/amoc_paperfigs.ipynb` demonstrates how to generate figures similar to those in Frajka-Williams et al. (2019, 2023) papers, including filtered time series, component breakdowns, and multi-array comparisons.

**Note**: PyGMT can be challenging to install due to its dependency on GMT. See the [PyGMT installation guide](https://www.pygmt.org/latest/install.html) for platform-specific instructions. PyGMT is an optional dependency - all other AMOCatlas functionality works without it.

Example figures generated by the notebook:
